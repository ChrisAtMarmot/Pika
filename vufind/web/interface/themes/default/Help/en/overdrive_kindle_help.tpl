Reading Kindle eBooks from the library is easy. All you have to do is check out an eBook and deliver it to the Kindle device or Kindle reading app of your choice.
</p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<ol>
	<li><span class="helpTextStep">Get a Kindle (or Kindle Reading App)</span>
		<p>
		Kindle eBooks can be read on all Kindle devices. Kindles with a Wi-Fi internet connection can download most books directly from Amazon without using a computer.  
		If your Kindle is not Wi-Fi capable you will need to transfer the Kindle Book to your computer before transferring it to your Kindle.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you don't have a Kindle you can still read Kindle books, but you will need to install a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000493771">free Kindle Reading App</a> to your computer, phone, or tablet.
	</li>
	<li><span class="helpTextStep">Find a book to read.</span>
		<p>
		Find a title you want to read from the library catalog (this site). <em>Hint:  to find books compatible with Kindles, include the word "Kindle" in your search!</em>
		<p>
		If the title is currently available you will see a <strong>Check Out</strong> button below the cover image.
		If all copies of the title are currently checked out you will see a <strong>Place Hold</strong> button below the cover image.
		When you place a hold on a title you will be notified by e-mail when the title is available for use. 
		</p>
		<p>
		To checkout the title, click on the <strong>Check Out</strong> button.
		If you have not logged into the library website you will be prompted to log in to the library site. 
		After you have logged in 

    When you see the Get for Kindle button, click it to go to Amazon's website which allows you to send the book to a Kindle device.

    Note: Certain publishers' titles are not available for over-the-air delivery. If over-the-air delivery is not available, you will need to download the title, then load it on to your Kindle over USB.

    Kindle Books checked out from your library are saved to your Kindle account so that you can download them again whenever you need to during the lending period.

		<p>
		Once you deliver a library book to your Kindle or Kindle reading app, it reads just like any other Kindle Book. Any notes you take, or bookmarks you make will be saved. If you ever check out the same title again, or buy it from the Kindle store, you'll find your notes safe and sound right where you left them.
		</p>
		<p>
		Another option is to read eBooks borrowed from your library on the Kindle Cloud Reader. All you need is a compatible browser (Chrome or Safari) and an Internet connection. As long as you're online, you can read Kindle Books right from your web browser.
		When you read Kindle Books from your library, your bookmarks, notes, and reading progress are all synced with your Kindle account. That means, if you make a note in a book you're reading on the Kindle Cloud Reader, you can look at it later on your Kindle or Kindle Reading App as long as you have Internet access.
