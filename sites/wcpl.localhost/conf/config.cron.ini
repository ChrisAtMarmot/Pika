# Configures the processes that cron will run when it is invoked with
# additional information about the frequency that it is invoked.
# The ini file should have a Processes section with the name of each process to run
#
# Processes should have the format:
#  - Process Name = Process Handler Class
#
# Each process will also have a section based on the Process Name.
# the section should contain the following keys at a minimum
# - description = A brief decription of what the process does
# - lastRun = the timestamp the process was last run.  Blank if the process has never been run.
# - frequencyHours = the frequency with which the process should be run in hours or 0 if it should be run each time cron runs.
#
# General settings can also be defined that will be sent to all processes.
# these can include database connection information, solr settings, etc.
